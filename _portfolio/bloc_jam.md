## Explanation

This web application is designed to have music player user interfaces that allows users to traverse through different albums and songs inside of it. As user plays musics in album, they are allowed to use control nob on the bottom of the player to move between musics and utilize seekbars to control volume and move through the song. 

## Problem

Current problem that I'm facing with this application is that as I move the volume control in control pane, music suddenly put at halt and comes back on playing when volume control is moved.

## Solution

This problem could be resolved by asserting another conditional statement on volume control seekbar function.

## Results

As a result, this application became fully functional music player and more albums and musics can be added to act as a complete music player that are ready to be hosted on web server.

## Conclusion

To improve, I will combine chatting application and community web post inside of this music player, and I will let users to upload their own music so that people can easily share their musics and discuss about music through community posts and chatting applicaiton.
